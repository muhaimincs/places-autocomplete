This repo shows how to integrate Redux and Redux-Observable Epics in Next.js.

Usually splitting your app state into `pages` feels natural but sometimes you'll want to have global state for your app. This is an example on how you can use redux that also works with Next.js's universal rendering approach.

## How to run
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
